In the final course, we'll tie together the concepts that you’ve learned up until now. You'll tackle real-world scenarios in Qwiklabs that will challenge you to use multiple skills at once.

First, we'll take a closer look at how to use external Python modules to extend your code's capabilities, and spend some time learning how to use documentation to learn a new module. For example, we'll use the Python Image Library (PIL) to create and modify images. We'll show you some simple examples of how to perform common tasks in the course material, but it will be up to you to explore the module documentation to figure out how to solve specific problems. 

Next, we'll show you how to communicate with the world outside of your code! You'll use data serialization to turn in-memory objects into messages that can be sent to other programs. Your program will send messages across the network to Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) offered by other programs. For those times when your code needs to talk to a person instead of a program, you'll also learn to send email messages. 

At the end of this course, you’ll be able to take a description of a problem and use your skills to create a solution -- just like you would on the job. In your final capstone project, you'll be given a description of what your customer needs, and it will be up to you to create a program to do it!

## Introduction
You work for an online fruits store, and you need to develop a system that will update the catalog information with data provided by your suppliers. The suppliers send the data as large images with an associated description of the products in two files (.TIF for the image and .txt for the description). The images need to be converted to smaller jpeg images and the text needs to be turned into an HTML file that shows the image and the product description. The contents of the HTML file need to be uploaded to a web service that is already running using Django. You also need to gather the name and weight of all fruits from the .txt files and use a Python request to upload it to your Django server.

You will create a Python script that will process the images and descriptions and then update your company's online website to add the new products.

Once the task is complete, the supplier should be notified with an email that indicates the total weight of fruit (in lbs) that were uploaded. The email should have a PDF attached with the name of the fruit and its total weight (in lbs).

Finally, in parallel to the automation running, we want to check the health of the system and send an email if something goes wrong.

What you'll do
Write a script that summarizes and processes sales data into different categories
Generate a PDF using Python
Automatically send a PDF by email
Write a script to check the health status of the system
